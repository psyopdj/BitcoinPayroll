# Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment

Make sure that you have a virtual python environment setup with the required packages installed.

Use your IDE or follow the steps below.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the app

```bash
# run
$ python main.py
```

The app runs locally on your machine with this URL.

`` http://127.0.0.1:5000/``

Go to the URL on your browser to take a look at the app or use ``curl`` to make any API requests.
